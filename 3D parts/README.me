READ THIS BEFORE PRINTING THE 3D PARTS

Inside the 3D parts folder you will see 3 different formats, the STL ones are the parts you can print, and the other 2 you can download them and 
edit it (if you use SOLIDWORKS you will be able to change things for sure, as I used it to make the design).

Things you need to print

- 1 BASE
- 1 BATTERY_HOLDER_COVER
- 2 BATTERY_HOLDER_HOLDER
- 1 CASE
- 1 LEVER
- 2 METAL_BAR_FIXING_COVER
- 1 POTENCIOMETER_COVER
- 2 PUSHBUTTON COVER
