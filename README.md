Programmable arduino chess clock with LCD and membrane keyboard

- Maximum time of 59:59 minutes

## How to use the chess clock
- To pause/resume just click the "C" button on the membrane keyboard
- To modify each player's time first you have to pause it ("C") and then click "A" or "B" to modify white or black's time respectively, 
  then enter the new time, for example, if you want to set the time to 12:30 minutes just click "1" then "2" and finally "3". When
  something finishes with "0" it isn't necessary to enter "0" but you can type it if you want.
-To change the increment(remember that starts with 2 seconds) of each player first the time has to be paused. Next you have to click the "D" 
 button and click " * "  or "#", whether you want to add seconds or minutes. Once this is done you will be able to type the increment. When you finish 
 press "D" and then you will be able to resume the match.
